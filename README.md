## Description

This project is a comprehensive summary of the back-end trimester, focusing on key concepts and technologies such as authentication, Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, pagination, and background processing.

The goal is to build a simple platform for file management, allowing users to:  
- Authenticate via a token.  
- List all files.  
- Upload new files.  
- Change file permissions.  
- View files.  
- Generate thumbnails for image files.  

You will be guided step-by-step through the process, but you have the freedom to implement additional features, split the logic into multiple files, and utilize a `utils` folder for modularity.

This project is for learning purposes and demonstrates how to assemble various components into a functional product.

**Enjoy building your Files Manager!**
